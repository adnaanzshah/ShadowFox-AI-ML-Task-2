# ShadowFox-AI-ML-Task-2
 This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on their features. The dataset includes attributes such as the type of fuel, the number of years the car has been in service, the showroom price, kilometers driven, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history.  The system guides users in estimating the value of their vehicles by training a regression model on historical data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation. Advanced machine learning techniques like Random Forest Regressor and hyperparameter tuning are applied to achieve high prediction accuracy.  The final model can be deployed as a web application or API, enabling users to input car details and receive estimated selling prices instantly. This solution is ideal for individuals and dealers looking to make informed decisions about car sales or purchases. Future improvements include adding more features, optimizing the model, and enhancing the user interface.
