# Car Selling Price Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on several attributes. The dataset includes details like fuel type, years of service, showroom price, kilometers driven, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history.

---

## Problem Statement
To create a system that predicts the selling price of a car based on its features. The model helps users get an approximate value for their vehicle.

---

## Features of the Dataset
- **Selling_Price**: Target variable (in lakhs).
- **Present_Price**: Original showroom price (in lakhs).
- **Kms_Driven**: Total kilometers driven by the car.
- **Fuel_Type**: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
- **Seller_Type**: Type of seller (e.g., Dealer, Individual).
- **Transmission**: Transmission type (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
- **Owner**: Number of previous owners.
- **Years_Used**: Calculated as `Current Year - Year of Manufacture`.

---

## Steps to Build the Model

### 1. Data Collection
   - Collect the dataset with relevant features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Drop irrelevant columns (e.g., `Car_Name` if it exists).
   - Add a derived feature, **Years_Used**, to indicate the car's age.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Analyze distributions of numerical features like `Selling_Price`, `Present_Price`, etc.
   - Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (`Selling_Price`).
   - Identify correlations using a heatmap.

### 4. Feature Engineering
   - Encode categorical variables (`Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`) into numerical formats using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features if needed.

### 5. Data Splitting
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.

### 6. Model Selection
   - Use regression models like **Random Forest Regressor**, **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, or **Linear Regression**.
   - Random Forest is preferred for its ability to handle complex datasets.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Optimize the model using techniques like **RandomizedSearchCV** or **GridSearchCV**.

### 8. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like:
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
     - **R-squared (RÂ²)**

### 9. Deployment
   - Deploy the model as a web application or an API using frameworks like **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
   - Allow users to input car details and get predictions.

### 10. Continuous Monitoring
   - Monitor the system's performance post-deployment.
   - Gather feedback and update the model with new data periodically.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the ML model.
- **Flask/FastAPI** (optional): For deploying the system.

## How to Run

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Install required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn flask
     ```

2. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Place the dataset file (e.g., `car.csv`) in the working directory.

3. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Run the script to clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding, etc.).

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Execute the script to train the ML model.

5. **Evaluate and Save the Model**:
   - Save the trained model using `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment.

6. **Deploy**:
   - Create a web app or API to serve predictions using frameworks like Flask.

## Example Output

1. **Input**:
   - `Fuel_Type`: Petrol
   - `Present_Price`: 8.5
   - `Kms_Driven`: 30000
   - `Years_Used`: 5
   - `Seller_Type`: Individual
   - `Transmission`: Manual
   - `Owner`: 1

2. **Output**:
   - Predicted Selling Price: **â‚¹5.4 lakhs**

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate more features like car brand and condition.
- Use advanced algorithms like XGBoost or deep learning models.
- Enhance the web interface for better user interaction.
